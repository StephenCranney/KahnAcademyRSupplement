Frequency tables were already touched on in the lesson on "categorical data displays," but to reiterate, you can create a frequency table by simply placing the variable inside the *table* command: 

```{r}

table(mtcars$gear)

```

As described in the KA lecture, dot plots are very similar, but use dots to denote frequency instead of the more straight-up numbers. 

```{r}
dotchart(mtcars$gear)
```

Once again, there are various ways to tweak the dot plot (see http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/dot.html).  

Finally, histograms are created with the *hist* command (hopefully you are beginning to see the pattern).
```{r}
hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

Once again, this basic graph can be developed and refined: https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-make-a-histogram-with-basic-r/.
